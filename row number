1)ROW NUMBER without partition by
  SELECT 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER(ORDER BY name ASC) AS Row#,
  name, recovery_model_desc
  FROM sys.databases 
  WHERE database_id < 5;

2)ROW NUMBER with partition by
  SELECT 
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY recovery_model_desc ORDER BY name ASC) 
      AS Row#,
    name, recovery_model_desc
  FROM sys.databases WHERE database_id < 5;

3)Ranking all rows in a result set
  SELECT TOP(10) BusinessEntityID, Rate,   
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Rate DESC) AS RankBySalary  
  FROM HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory AS eph1  
  WHERE RateChangeDate = (SELECT MAX(RateChangeDate)   
                        FROM HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory AS eph2  
                        WHERE eph1.BusinessEntityID = eph2.BusinessEntityID)  
  ORDER BY BusinessEntityID;

4)Ranking all rows in a result set using dense rank
  SELECT TOP(10) BusinessEntityID, Rate,   
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY Rate DESC) AS RankBySalary  
  FROM HumanResources.EmployeePayHistory;
